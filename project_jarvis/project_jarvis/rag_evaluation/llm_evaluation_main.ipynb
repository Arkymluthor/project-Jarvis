You will need to review the project plans and documentation to effectively determine the scope of the project.\\n\\nTraditionally, estimators would get their hands on 2D project plans and start to identify quantities and measurements from there. Now, thanks to leading construction estimating software, teams can view project plans in 3D, so they can get an enhanced view of the project and gain a better understanding of design intent.', 'https://samplehtmlstore.blob.core.windows.net/autodesk/adsk-1f18ad1c58954694aa66243aa7c1068c.html': ' With a unified experience, there’s no need to create two separate accounts and have two onboarding experiences for two different products.\\n\\nWhy Risk-Adjusted Cost Is the Future\\n\\nDeveloping accurate cost estimates is both an art and a science. The art of cost estimating has been refined over time by preconstruction professionals with decades of invaluable experience. However, with higher stakes than ever, it is vital to ensure that construction organizations also anticipate the implicit costs of performing complex projects.\\n\\nToday, by using TradeTapp and BuildingConnected to help anticipate and surface risk insights, firms can plan for the possibilities earlier on in the\\n\\nproject lifecycle. As technology continues to improve and data becomes more readily available, a risk-adjusted cost estimating approach will help general contractors uncover an even wider breadth of risk factors, helping ensure project success time and time again.\\n\\nContributing Authors: Christina Hu, Copywriter, Autodesk Construction Solutions; Dustin DeVan, Construction Industry Strategist and Evangelist at Autodesk Construction Solutions and '}\n",
