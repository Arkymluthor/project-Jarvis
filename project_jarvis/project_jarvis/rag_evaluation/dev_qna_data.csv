And you can run AutoCAD 2021 and 3ds Max 2020 at the same time (for single or multi-user, one license consumed)."
How mixed licenses are consumed,"If a license file contains a mix of different license types for the same product, a ranking logic determines which licenses from the pool are consumed first.
